        <p>Fire Island was the perfect escape! 
           The trip felt like stepping onto a true pedestrian paradise, as there are no cars allowed on most of the island. 
           We spent the days relaxing on the wide, beautiful beaches and watching the ferries come and go.
           We also explored the unique character of the different communities.
           The evenings were magical, defined by stunning sunsets over the water and quiet strolls back to our rental.
           Sometimes the best travels are the quiet ones!</p>
